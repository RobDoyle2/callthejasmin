<p>Due to unprecedented demand for second hand cars in Ireland after BREXIT, we have teamed up with ABC Motor Engineers to help car imports complete their mandatory ‘Customs Declarations’. We use technology and the vast experience of ABC Motor Engineers to deliver an automated service whether you want to import one or several hundred vehicles. No more having your goods delayed by customs, and an instant calculation on the amount of money requested by revenue. More information</p>
